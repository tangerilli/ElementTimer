Element Timer
--------------

Once the extension is installed, go to the extension options to enter a CSS selector.  Then, navigate to the page you're interested in.  Once an element matching the selector is made visible on the page, there will be some output in the console indicating the total time for that element to become visible (the start time is when the browser sends the page load request).

TODO

- Support multiple selectors
